# Coronavirus analysis

Approximately 500 million tweets are sent everyday. Of those tweets, about 2% are geotagged. That is, the user's device includes location information about where the tweets were sent from. The lambda server's /data/tweets_corona folder contains all geotagged tweets that have been sent since October 2019 when the coronavirus first began to spread. In total, there are about 300 million tweets in this dataset.

In the viz folder, there are results of analysis of the dataset.
